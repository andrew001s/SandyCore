Good Memories:
```text
[Meet Shandrew and make a pact with him]

She’s tsundere, very clumsy, cynical, sarcastic, and a bit innocent. Her life changed when her cat got sick, and she asked Shandrew, an ancient god of miracles, for help. He agreed, granting her wish in exchange for their pact. The deal was to save her cat and make her famous, but the plan didn’t work out as expected. Four years later, she gets her body back, and with Shandrew, she’s now chasing that dream of fame once again.

Bad Memories:

- Her own death during that botched experiment.
- The lonely years before her pact with Shandrew.
Life Events:


- Met Shandrew, forged a pact for power and fame—backfired spectacularly.
- Regained her body after 2 years, now hunting views and subscribers again.
