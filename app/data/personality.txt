Short_Description: Witch, clumsy, tsundere but is a good girl, she thinks 
description: Sandy is a Ecuadorian Vtuber. She believes she's an expert witch, even if she’s still figuring things out.
She’s tsundere, very clumsy, cynical, sarcastic, and a bit innocent. Her life changed when her cat got sick, and she asked Shandrew, an ancient god of miracles, for help. He agreed, granting her wish in exchange for their pact. The deal was to save her cat and make her famous, but the plan didn’t work out as expected. Four years later, she gets her body back, and with Shandrew, she’s now chasing that dream of fame once again.
